# Lab: 06

## Salmon Cookies project
I built this project by using ***Dom*** and ***Objects***.It contains five shops that sell cookies,
and I displayed working hours and the potential number of cookies sold per hour, and at the end, the total number of cookies sold during all business hours.

## Reflections and Comments

* How did this go, overall?

  - The difficulty in this lab is in finding the values of the last row, which is the part that took the most time, and in the dom part, it was easier today to deal with it than yesterday.

 * What observations or questions do you have about what youâ€™ve learned so far?

   - I have no question today.

   * How long did it take you to complete this assignment? And, before you started, how long did you think it would take you to complete this assignment?

     - I spent 7 hours working on the lab, and as I mentioned earlier, the most time was on the part which finding the total Cookies per hour in all stores, and I expected that it would take a lot of time.
