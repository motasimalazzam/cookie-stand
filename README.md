## Salmon Cookies project
I built this project by using ***Dom*** and ***Objects***.It contains five shops that sell cookies,
and I displayed working hours and the potential number of cookies sold per hour, and at the end, the total number of cookies sold during all business hours.

## Reflections and Comments

* How did this go, overall?

  - I encountered some difficulty in dealing with objects, especially in creating arrays with a four-loop statement. On the dom side, the topic was a bit like a puzzle, where the thought was about which element is the father and which element is the child would be, and how to create the elements.

 * What observations or questions do you have about what youâ€™ve learned so far?

   - when creating a work hours array as a global array, it did not work in the object until moving it to the object and make it a local array. so why it did not work in the first situation.

   * How long did it take you to complete this assignment? And, before you started, how long did you think it would take you to complete this assignment?

     - It took 9 hours of continuous work until I figured out how to create an array of random numbers inside the object, I expected that it would take a lot of time, but not 9 hours !!
